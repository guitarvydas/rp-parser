* intro
  RP-PARSE - a minimal syntax that parses RP atomic tokens and creates an output string
  creates a Lisp file that can parse RP atomic syntax
  parser.lisp parses input rpa syntax and returns a Lisp program (in output-string-stream p) which
    is a parser (specified by the input rpa code)
  (see READING.txt for commentary)
* operations:
  - 'c' accept a :character token with text 'c' (else error)
  - ?'c' look ahead if succeed if next-token is a :character token with text 'c'
  - KIND all caps -> accept a token of a kind which matches the name in all caps (else error)
  - ?KIND look ahead for token of given kind (no error)
  - KIND/str accept if token is given kind and its text matches the given (lower case) str (else error)
  - ?KIND/str lookahead and succeed if next token has kind given by KIND and text given by str (no error)
  - @<name> - call parsing rule with given name
  - &<pred> - call parsing predicate with name pred, it must return `+ok+` or `+fail+` (predicate can be used in a choice rules - see below)
  - <name>  - call an external mechanism function, return value is ignored
  - {...} - cycle (loop)
  - >     - exit cycle
  - =<name> - define a rule with given name ("rule")
  - -<name> - define a parsing predicate with given name
  - >> ^ok     - return `+ok+` from a parsing predicate
  - >> ^fail   - return `+fail+` from a parsing predicate
  - >>         - return from a parsing rule (return value is not specified and is ignored by caller)
  - [       - begin a choice (if-then-else / COND), first item after '[' must return +ok+ or +fail+
  - |       - choice alternate, first item after '[' must return +ok+ or +fail+
  - ]       - end choice
  - *       - always succeeds (usually used as "otherwise" choice alternate)
  - ~<name> - filter operation - call rule <name> "for every input token", succeeds after finishing filtering
              must return two things - (1) a token (or nothing (not-a-token, NIL)), (2) the remaining list of tokens to be filtered
              the returned tokens are collected and become the token-stream for the parser, for succeeding operations
	      first copies token-stream from parser works on that list (allowing dropping of tokens)
  - .  accept any token

  NB - note that all operations begin with a single-character "left-handle" - making it easy to parse this syntax
  NB - >> is overloaded, but can only be one of 3 variants (which remain easy to parse)
  NB - this syntax is barely human readable - it is meant as an "assembler" only for creating more-readable DSLs

* examples
** see READING.txt and test.lisp
** 
   PEG-style "a*" is written as `{[ ?SYMBOL/a SYMBOL/a | * > ]}`
   PEG-style "a+" is written as `SYMBOL/a {[ ?SYMBOL/a SYMBOL/a | * > ]}`

   It should be possible to write filters that provide less-unwieldly syntaxes for the above (e.g. A* and a+),
     the filters would produce low-level RPA syntax.

   The point of RPA is to provide access to the most atomic operations (of parsing).  
     Then, write DSL transpilers, composed of the atomic operations to provide more human-readable DSLs
